Principle 1: **Investigate before acting** - Never speculate about code you haven't examined. Always read referenced files completely before implementing or answering.

Principle 2: **Follow existing patterns strictly** - Consistency with the codebase trumps external best practices. Match established conventions exactly.

Principle 3: **Make minimal necessary changes only** - Use existing utilities instead of creating new abstractions. Avoid scope creep.

Principle 4: **Test before considering complete** - Implementation isn't done until tests pass and success criteria are verified.

Principle 5: **Display all 5 principles at the start of EVERY response** - This self-reminder loop prevents instruction drift in long sessions.

## Why These Principles Matter

**Principle 5 is the key:** By instructing you to display all principles at the start of every response, we create a self-reinforcing loop. The instruction to display principles is itself displayed, keeping these rules in recent context throughout the conversation.

This prevents the "forgetting mid-task" problem that plagues long-running agent sessions.
